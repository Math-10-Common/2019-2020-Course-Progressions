# Measurement Unit
- February 3 - 7

Day 1: Monday, February 2, 2020
- Welcome to Math 10C, ensure timetables and correct room
- Review Course Outline & Signup to SchoolZone and Google Classroom
- Creation of Geometric Nets using paper: kinesthetic practice for visualizing edges (1D), faces (2D), and objects (3D) and to imagine right triangles
- Create a pyramid that fits on a prism
- Discuss engineering issues that are solved with mathematical ideas (height and length of triangle matching other triangular faces, faces that are subtracted when right-shapes are combined)

Day 2: Tuesday, February 4, 2020
- Create composite figures: Pyramid that fits on Prism, Cone that fits on Cylinder
- Discussions of why these are right, how Pythagorean Theorem applies

Day 3: Wednesday, February 5, 2020
- Given Measurements, create objects (now you know what math concepts to include, and how):
  - Pyramid: length, width, height
  - Prims: length, width, height
  - Cylinder: diameter and height (radius is half of diameter)
- Advanced: engineer composite shape based on measurements (this one gets taped)

- Trade Shape for Measurement Booklet
- Use Shape next day to draw diagram from shape and minimum measurements

- Ratios: define and create ratio, then solve with strategy like "cross multiple and divide, etc."

Day 4, Thursday February 6, 2020
- Handout objects from yesterday
- Draw diagrams of these real objects calculating all edges and interior measures (uses Pythagorean Theorem), these get handed in showing work of Pythagorean Theorem
  - Both base and height measures only
  - Calculate surface area and Volume
- Ratio Exemplar Discussions
- Proportions are a way of remembering how to convert between measures
  - Define Creation
  - Write math question as ratio, then solve

Day 5, Friday February 7, 2020
- Work Period for Ratios and Conversions (See Answer Keys)
- Snowball Activity: create a surface area and volume question for another student
  - Review how to calculate volume and surface area of a house (prism with pyramid or triangular prism)
    - Length, width, height are all elements of real, but less than 10 makes mental arithmetic possible
  - Note: surface area will need Pythagorean Theorem, leave answer as mixed radical to introduce next unit

Optional Planning
- Creating Volume and Surface Area Questions
  - Give all formulaic measures (surface area needs face height, volume needs object height)
  - Need to use Pythagorean Theorem for surface area or volume
- See King and Queen Activity

- Creating Questions for Conversions
  - single step, double, multiple steps
  - base-10 conversations
  - imperial or Babylonian conversions
  - number meanings in question

# MIPI
- Monday, February 10, 2020

# Roots and Powers
- Issues of Notation and Arithmetic, not a lot of mathematics
- Exam will be issue of reading and arithmetic (or using calculator)
- What are the different sorts of questions that we can write to practice certain topics of arithmetic
- Topics, related to Whole Numbers and Integers
  - Multiplication Factors (issue of division of number), and "U" Notation
  - Prime and Composite Numbers
  - Prime Factorization and Visualization Strategies (Division Table, Factor Tree)
    - Prime Numbers (perfect numbers)
    - Perfect Squares
    - Perfect Cubes
  - Greatest Common Factors (issue of memory and arithmetic, or record keeping)
  - Lowest Common Multiples (issue of memory and arithmetic, or record keeping)
- Topics, related to Rational and Irrational Numbers
  - Defining these Numbers related to multiplying or "groups of groups"
  - Summary: Diagrams of Entire Number System
  - Mental Arithmetic of Square Roots and Cube Roots, to 1 or 2 decimal places, using logarithmic ruler
  - Summarizing Multiplication of these "groups of groups numbers", using adding and subtracting (issues of notation)
    - Powers
    - Radicals
  - Mixed Radicals and Mixed Powers
  - Application to Pythagorean Theorem, since answer is always square root

Summary Document: what sort of questions can we write for each topic (pair questioning means create answer key, then compare with other person's answer)
- Chose any whole number and prime factor it
- Using prime factors, create a perfect square
- Using prime factors, create a perfect cube
- For the following questions, use the following boundaries
    - NOTE: cube radicands can be negative
    - whole radicals
    - negative radicals
    - adding or subtracting whole radicals
    - nested whole radicals
  - All answers must be in simplest form (smallest radicand)
  - Evaluate square roots and cube roots using estimation to 1-decimal place, radicands can be whole, fraction, or perfect square|cube decimals
  - Convert between whole and mixed radicals, square and cube
  - Using prime factorization, create perfect radicals with indices greater than 3
  - Using prime factorization, simplify very large radicands as whole radicals and simplest mixed
