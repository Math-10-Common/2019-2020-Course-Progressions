More Detailed Descriptions of Math 10C Course

**Purpose**: daily descriptions of Math 10 Common Curriculum with reflections about algorithms and connections to Computer Science

# Measurement Unit

Day 1: Monday, February 2, 2020
- Welcome to Math 10C, ensure timetables and correct room
- Review Course Outline & Signup to SchoolZone and Google Classroom
- Creation of Geometric Nets using paper: kinesthetic practice for visualizing edges (1D), faces (2D), and objects (3D) and to imagine right triangles
- Create a pyramid that fits on a prism
- Discuss engineering issues that are solved with mathematical ideas (height and length of triangle matching other triangular faces, faces that are subtracted when right-shapes are combined)

Day 2: Tuesday, February 4, 2020
- Create composite figures: Pyramid that fits on Prism, Cone that fits on Cylinder
- Draw diagrams of these real objects calculating all edges and interior measures (uses Pythagorean Theorem)
- Only Measurement:
  - Pyramid: length, width, height
  - Prims: length, width, height
  - Cylinder: diameter and height (radius is half of diameter)
- Advanced: engineer composite shape based on measurements (this one gets taped)

Optional Planning
- Creating Volume and Surface Area Questions
  - Give all formulaic measures (surface area needs face height, volume needs object height)
  - Need to use Pythagorean Theorem for surface area or volume
- See King and Queen Activity
- Proportions are a way of remembering how to convert between measures
  - Define Creation
  - Write math question as ratio, then solve
- Creating Questions for Conversions
  - single step, double, multiple steps
  - base-10 conversations
  - imperial or Babylonian conversions
