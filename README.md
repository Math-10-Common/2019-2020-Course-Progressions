# Measurement Unit
- February 3 - 7

Day 1: Monday, February 2, 2020
- Welcome to Math 10C, ensure timetables and correct room
- Review Course Outline & Signup to SchoolZone and Google Classroom
- Creation of Geometric Nets using paper: kinesthetic practice for visualizing edges (1D), faces (2D), and objects (3D) and to imagine right triangles
- Create a pyramid that fits on a prism
- Discuss engineering issues that are solved with mathematical ideas (height and length of triangle matching other triangular faces, faces that are subtracted when right-shapes are combined)

Day 2: Tuesday, February 4, 2020
- Create composite figures: Pyramid that fits on Prism, Cone that fits on Cylinder
- Discussions of why these are right, how Pythagorean Theorem applies

Day 3: Wednesday, February 5, 2020
- Given Measurements, create objects (now you know what math concepts to include, and how):
  - Pyramid: length, width, height
  - Prims: length, width, height
  - Cylinder: diameter and height (radius is half of diameter)
- Advanced: engineer composite shape based on measurements (this one gets taped)

- Trade Shape for Measurement Booklet
- Use Shape next day to draw diagram from shape and minimum measurements

- Ratios: define and create ratio, then solve with strategy like "cross multiple and divide, etc."

Day 4, Thursday February 6, 2020
- Handout objects from yesterday
- Draw diagrams of these real objects calculating all edges and interior measures (uses Pythagorean Theorem), these get handed in showing work of Pythagorean Theorem
  - Both base and height measures only
  - Calculate surface area and Volume
- Ratio Exemplar Discussions
- Proportions are a way of remembering how to convert between measures
  - Define Creation
  - Write math question as ratio, then solve

- Snowball Activity: create a surface area and volume question for another student
  - Review how to calculate volume and surface area of a house (prism with pyramid or triangular prism)
    - Length, width, height are all elements of real, but less than 10 makes mental arithmetic possible
  - Note: surface area will need Pythagorean Theorem, leave answer as mixed radical to introduce next unit

Optional Planning

# Polynomials
- See Student Notes Package and Workbook in Folder

Vocabulary and Concepts
- Review of Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers, will become part of a number-based Factoring Game (Sum-Product)
  - Include what an inverse number is (compared to reciprocal from Exponent Laws)
- Review vertical elementary math multiplication (1x1, 2x1, 2x2) to compare place-value to terms in a polynomial
  - Compare vertical and horizontal notations to traditional questions used to explain distributive property in horizontal notation
  - Include variable representation (words like FOIL, formulaic) and image descriptions
- Review reading Order of Operations where brackets have new meaning
  - BEDMAS (American), PEMDAS (Canadian, Australian), an Image (Mercerian), etc.
  - Multiplication symbol "x" changes to brackets "packaging entire polynomial" and introduces Distributive Property
  - "Multiply By" in `3(2x)`
- "Polynomials are built on a variable and relationships to a single variable instance"
  - "From x, build a polynomial with symbols and vocabulary"
  - Illustrates relationships to variable, explored in later topics like Relations and Functions, Linear Functions, etc.
- Arithmetic Goal: "Multiplying Polynomials and Factoring Polynomials happen at the same time â€¦ called verification"
- Monomial
- Binomial
- Trinomial
- Terms and Common Term
- Coefficients
- Variables
- Exponents (and applicable exponent laws)
- Degree of Term
- Degree of Polynomial
- Symbols with adding and subtracting
- Inverse Polynomials (including inverse monomial, binomial, and trinomial)
- Writing Polynomials
  - ordering degree largest to smallest
  - ordering variables alphabetically
  - ordering variables attending to potential binomial-factors (usually for trinomials)
- Types of Polynomial Formulae
  - A,B,C,D are elements of the Real Number System
  - Standard Form: Ax^2 + Bx + C
  - General Form: Ax^2 + Bx + C = D
  - Note: D is often zero, so solving for X here is called finding zeros
  - Note: Sometimes "finding zeros" is confused with graphing question "finding roots", both have same meaning of "find x"

Common Arithmetic (question is often, "write the most simplified polynomial")
- Adding and Subtracting of monomials or like-terms (also called simplifying)
  - Includes inverse polynomials
  - Note: here horizontal notation is most common
  - Examples with vertical notation introduce Systems of Equations, a future topic
- Multiplying polynomials (also called expanding and simplifying) and uses horizontal notation mostly
  - Fun Fact: Horizontal Notation was popularized by textbook publishers whose printing presses handled words in paragraphs easier than how we write common mathematics
- Note: dividing polynomials is beyond scope of this course and includes Rationalizing the Denominator

Common Word Problem Topics
- Profit as functions (formulae) using graphing concepts of profit-loss (also called linear functions, a future topic)
- Distance as d=Vt
- Distance as perimeter in a compound shape (with polynomial edges that must be calculated)
- Area as A=lw in rectangles or compound shapes using other 2D area formulae (triangle, circle, parallelogram, rhombus, quadrilateral, etc.)
- Finding side lengths in right triangles using Pythagorean Theorem
  - Note: designing questions in Math 10C must start with hypotenuse as factorable polynomial
  - Utilizes unique factorable polynomials such as addition of squares or difference of squares
- Volume as V=lwh in rectangular prisms or rectangular compound prisms; and, using other 2D shapes such as prisms with different bases, pyramids, or cylinders

Common Mathematics of Polynomials
- "Reading the Polynomial to answer if it is factorable"
- "Rewriting the Polynomial"
  - decreasing degree
  - multiple variables written alphabetically or attending-to-factors
- "The number of terms give hint about amount of mathematics"
  - Note: check for GCF in any polynomial
  - 2-terms: difference of squares
  - 3-terms: decomposition (sum-product game) to create 4-term polynomial and factor-by-grouping
  - 4-term: factor-by-grouping (fancy name for GCF)
- CAUTION: advanced questions may have a GCF in one of the factors

Specific Notes
- Decomposition in a trinomial reverses the simplification of like terms
- Difference of Squares use conjugates and inverse conjugates
- Addition of Squares is a shortcut if it is recognizable when reading the polynomial for the first time
- Inverse conjugates and inverse factors creates some weird polynomials to factor. These are advanced questions

**When is a polynomial factored?** When its factors are "prime", not composite, monomials or binomials (no GCFs)
- future courses will explore non-"prime" factors (integers and rationals without GCFs) and trinomials not factorable by grouping or the Sum-Product game
